## CUE train model

This rmarkdown show how we train each imputation model. Three approaches for selecting weights for CUE can be found in paper.
```{r generate_simulation_data}
# generate HM450 as x and HM850 as y
n = 100              # number of sampels
x <- rbeta(n*50,1,1) # upperstream 25 probes and downstream 25 probes measured by HM450
y <- rbeta(n,1,1)    # the target HM850 probe
# hist(x)
# hist(y)
```

## Train with PFR

```{r PFR}
source("R/refund_lib.R")
```

## Train with XGBoosting

```{r xgb}
library(xgboost)
```

## Train with random forests

```{r RF}
library(randomForest)
```

## Train with KNN

```{r KNN}
library("class")
```



## Train with logistic regression

```{r Logistic}


```
